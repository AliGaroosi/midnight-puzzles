Ali's Observation and Surprise Measurement

Ali is sitting in his room. He thinks he hears the sound of the house door being opened at time t.

He waits to hear the sound of the door closing. Specify how surprised he would be if he hears the door being shut at t + T.

Notations:
E(t): Event of hearing the sound of the door at time t.
O(t): Event of the door being opened at time t.
C(t): Event of the door being closed at time t.
T follows a lognormal distribution with parameters μ and σ:
T ∼ Lognormal(μ, σ)
Every time the door is opened, it must eventually be closed.
The number of times O(t) occurs in an interval of length T follows a Poisson distribution:
O(T) ∼ Poisson(λ), where λ ≪ 1
The probability of hearing the sound given that the door is opened follows a Bernoulli distribution:
P(E(t) | O(t)) ∼ Bernoulli(p)
